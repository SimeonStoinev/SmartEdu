**_Smart Education_** is a project developed with Laravel. 
The main purpose of the website is to help school teachers manage tests as the project allows them to create freely online tests with closed and open tasks and thus, tests can be solved from the students.
Each student can access tests by an unique random generated code that the teacher is supposed to give. All codes are generated once a test is being activated.

Smart Education participated in the national olympiad of information technologies (NOIT, Bulgaria).
